## Alec Baker's GitHub 🔮

## About Me 👁️
I'm a beginner software developer currently studying computer science at UCF.
Here, I plan on uploading my personal passion projects and potentially collaborative efforts from my peers and I at UCF.

I have a particular interest in software engineering and video game design and devlopment. I'm always looking to improve and for new projects to work on, even if I sometimes find they may be a little too ambitious.

## Language Experience 🛠
C - my primary language of choice, very confident

Java - comfortable with a good understanding

Python - familiar
