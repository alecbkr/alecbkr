## 👁️ About Me 
I'm a beginning software developer currently studying computer science at UCF.
Here, I plan on uploading my personal passion projects as well as collaborative efforts from my peers and I at UCF.

I have a particular interest in software engineering and video game design + development. I'm always looking to improve and for new projects to work on, even if I sometimes find they may be a little too ambitious.

## 🛠 Language Experience 
C- my primary language of choice, very confident

Java- comfortable with a good understanding

Python- familiar
